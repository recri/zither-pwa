* Notes on getting faustwasm to work.
** mono guitar failed to load because of
  const { promises: fs } = await import("fs");
  const { pathToFileURL } = await import("url");
in test/out/faustwasm/index.js, but commenting out
the imports results in a working load.
** mono.dsp needed the same fix
** Tried chasing the fix around the source and failed
** Installed a new version of node.js
* The correct faustwasm is in the github archive
	https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustwasm
  everything else is legacy code that might not work.
* Chrome handles touch events in a clever way that isn't yet copied
  by others.  They set passive: true by default and ask tht you set
  css touch-action to specify which gestures you want to see.
* Safari doesn't support touch events at all according to MDN.
