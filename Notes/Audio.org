[ ] Looking at the elec/nylon/steel guitar control panels in standalone
    there aren't any adjustable parameters that determine the differences
    in their sound, the differences are wired into the models.
[ ] Making them standalone rediscovered all the wonderful things that I
    found out while making the zither adapter, to wit dynamic fetch of
    ./foo.js gets foo.js from the server root directory rather than from
    the source directory of the code that does the fetch.  And the web
    development server is relocating the code for the web site, but not
    anything else.  And the code in faustwasm/index.js that wants to load
    nodejs packages in case it's not running in a web browser.
[ ] Really want to have A/B setups where strings are going through different
    sets of synth params, and put the param controls on screen so we can
    twiddle and test and compare.
[ ] Should really move the shared effect to shared effect, and make it the
    same for everybody, and make it an effect rack.
[ ] It's really annoying that the controls for a polyphonic midi controlled
    synth still have the freq/gain/gate controls that can't do anything.
[ ] Okay, guitars can have multiple pickups, which means that you're getting
    the vibrations in different phases for certain.  They claim that the
    sound nearer the bridge is more trebly, and I suppose that could be true,
    though I'm not sure how to get that out of the eks.  But I can get
    multiple pickups by simply tapping the delay line at different points.
    Then the issue becomes where and how to combine the signals.
[ ] So we can tune the positions of pickups
[ ] Want to know why the eks is dropping out at different times, it makes no
    sense, there's nothing to mute the string, just a decay filter.
[ ] Stiffness slider in geoshred, on classical acoustic, goes from twang to
    clunk.
[ ] Palm mute is interesting, too, very fast decay, may just be shortening the
    decay time.
[ ] On the profiling, might it be that running multiple worklets allocates
    multiple cores?  So what might flop after four notes, could make it to eight
    if the strings were split between two or more worklets?
[ ] Looking more and more like I will only  have one audio back end with lots
    of tweakable knobs and leave the other audio for others to explore.
[ ] Getting a glitchy audio output from the iPad, it may have been dangling in
    the background for a while.  Discard and restart the app always works.
