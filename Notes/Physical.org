[ ] adding velocity/force sensitivity would make the instrument much better.
[ ] Found two projects on youtube using velostat and copper tape to make a
    pressure sensitive matrix.
[ ] One project was making a sensor for a yoga mat.

[ ] The other was making a midi-matrix homomorphic keyboard.

    This project uses two CD74HC4067 16:1 multiplexors connected to 15
    rows and 15 columns driven by a Teensy 4.0
[ ] The technique can be made into a jlcpcb project.  Design two pcbs, one
    with the rows and the other with the columns of a sensor matrix.  
    The pcbs will sandwich one or more layers of velostat, so as to measure
    the resistance between a row electrode and a column electrode, which is
    proportional to the pressure on the assembly at that point.
[ ] The sensor matrix pcbs also include the circuitry for scanning the matrix.
    One set of shift registers scans a one bit across the row electrodes.
    A second set of shift registers will select the column to be
[ ] Romain Michon's force sensor was much simpler and more elegant.

    He placed 4 force sensitive resistors at the corners of the iPad,
    calibrated their force sensitivity, AM modulated carriers at 4, 6, 10,
    and 14kHz with the signals, sent the mixed signal as an audio input
    to the iPad, and demodulated the signal with Faust.
[ ] I'm thinking velostat matrix to Teensy touchscreen usb device
