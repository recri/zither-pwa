[x] turn off the logging!
[x] default to eks
[x] even with eks the pixel 7a crashes the zither window when
[x] implement the mechanical properties page (strings, courses, frets, tunings, etc.)
[x] implement the audio device properties page.
[x] implement the audio device selection page.
[?] switching orientation on device rotation is very disruptive.
[x] rotating from portrait to landscape and back reduces the fretlabels to microscopic
    in portrait.  The sizes are stable after the first two swaps.
    Other oddities arise, too, the control panel resizes and relocates to mid screen.
[x] eks - don't see why the pick position is restricted to 0.5 max, maybe it's symmetric
    around the midpoint?
[?] the pm guitar models appear to use string models, bridge models, nut models, pick
    position, direction, angle, pickup location.  I'm not seeing that they share a parameter
    space, between the different guitars.  tweak the string stiffness.  Well work at
    figuring it out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[?] I like the Obsidian idea of pushing everything into an infinite canvas,
    rather than imposing some predefined structuring onto the set of possibilities.
[?] So we start with a keyboard/fretboard/whatever playing surface, and a patch
    for the sound engine.  Pinch to zoom shrinks the current patch/surface to its
    representation on the infinite canvas, where push to scroll, pinch to zoom, and
    drag to move allow you to rearrange.
[x] the toplevel faust directory needs to clone and set up the faustwasm application
	and use it to do the processing.  Rather than depending on the clone that I
	made manually.  I don't know if it depends on the faust installation, I think
	not but I should test.  Use faustwasm as a dev dependency
[?] The models need to be as lean as possible.  Multi notes choke the ONN tablet.
[?] there's a thought about sharing the delay line between instances of the synth.
[?] The pixel 7a choked after a while
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Does the full screen API give better control over miscellaneous chrome?
    Well, some of the chrome hangs around on the iPad, but it really cleans up
    on android.
[x] PWA can exit with window.close().
    Only on more recent devices.  SE failed to exit or even make noise.  Moto
    failed to exit. 
[x] PWA can be forced to update by changes to webmanifest or service worker.
[x] Can solve button accessibility problems with sl-button, and use the
    sl-icon library, too.  
	Use 'gear' settings icon for 'tune instrument'.
	Use 'x-large' for 'close instrument'.
	Use 'music-note-beamed' for 'play instrument'.
[?] Fix the background on the zither desktop icon theme color? ...
    I get white on IOS and gray on Android.
    I think I'm stuck with them.
[x] Can detect touchscreen with media query:
    if(window.matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)").matches) {
      // touchscreen
    }
    https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#descdef-media-any-pointer
    Can confess to the failings of the program on desktops and laptops.
    Didn't work.
[x] Implement mouse events which happen when the mouse isn't emulating touch.
[?] Need a tone control that tracks the string's fundamental frequency.
    https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/libs/filters/ faust filter library
    has parts for assembling an equalizer.
[x] Don't need the nonlinear junk.
[x] Make the 'tune' button on the fretboard only show after some time
    without played notes, then it can fade back in, fade out as soon as
    playing starts.  No fade, simply comes or goes.
[x] Fix the mandolin.
[x] Eliminate the shorthand tunings.
[x] Fix the 8 string bass tunings.
[x] Add a bunch of harp tunings.
[x] make the parameter code save to localstorage
[x] Add an export link to clipboard, box-arrow-up icon    
[x] Cleaned out effect code from active eks.dsp
[x] Clean up color palettes, make contrasting text color.
[x] Make poly a parameter
[x] sharp/flat preferences by key are not working, all come out sharps.
[x] Break the Audio panel into pieces.  Audio/Excite/Loop

[ ] may want a soft touch limit, might even be able to run a test to find it, virtual
	tapping at various rates, record successful tests in the database, record the
	start of unsuccessful tests in the database, choose boundaries from 
[ ] recheck performance limits
[ ] make a zither layout
[ ] make a dulcimer layout
[ ] make the 5-string banjo work
[ ] make an 8-string mandolin
[ ] make a 12-string guitar
[ ] make fretless instruments
    but still tapping interface versions, not bowed or plucked.
[ ] make an oud
[ ] use the position of the touch on the fretnote to modulate trigger parameters,
    pick direction from position above or below the string,
    pick position from location between the frets,
[ ] A scrolling gesture can retune the fretboard, either by moving the nut up or down
	or by side scrolling to change the strings.
    This could be active when the gear pages are active.  Change individual string tunings
    by sliding the string.  Change the transpose by grabbing several strings and sliding them.
[ ] A pinch to zoom gesture could change the number of strings, or adjust the fret spacing.
[ ] test whether touch contains shape information that might work for a barre.
[ ] make a muting interface to quiet the strings
[ ] Send each note on its own channel, so it will have its own channel messages.
    Try and see if it works on the existing polyphony implementation, or make it
    work by loading multiple eks and allocating them to touches
[ ] make sure that pwa builds from github, may have lost some of the copy logic
    required to recreate out-tsc and dist from scratch.
[ ] Add more help text.
[ ] Detect lack of touchscreen by seeing the corresponding mouse events.
[ ] Need stiffness.
[ ] line of green at bottom of fretboard, off by one?  On the IPad mini
[ ] resize the harp buttons, maybe tilt them from corner to corner to make
    more space.
[ ] Reinstate the shorthand tunings, assuming you can translate all such guitar
    tunings programatically.
[ ] if you're at B0 on a bass fretboard, there is no octave below.
    Maybe transpose is the lowest midi note tuned, cannot go below 0
[ ] midi output
[ ] midi input
[ ] osc output
[ ] osc input
[ ] add preset page, bookmarks for different instruments
[ ] excitation pulse with P that actually decays to zero
[ ] Build a half-sample-rate delay line to handle low notes, 
    if P > Pmax && P < Pmax*2, then build a divide by two buffer which gets
    filled with copies of eks on one clock, then drained of copies on the
    other clocks.
[ ] shaped noise pulses. use pulse length which decays to zero
[ ] shaped noise pulses. sparse pulses
[ ] shaped noise pulses. pulses with envelopes
[ ] set up A/B experiments to compare strings with different voicings
[ ] multiple pickups combined with variable gain.
