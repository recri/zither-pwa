[x] turn off the logging!
[x] default to eks
[x] even with eks the pixel 7a crashes the zither window when
[ ] may want a soft touch limit, might even be able to run a test to find it, virtual
	tapping at various rates, record successful tests in the database, record the
	start of unsuccessful tests in the database, choose boundaries from 
[ ] recheck performance limits
[x] implement the mechanical properties page (strings, courses, frets, tunings, etc.)
[x] implement the audio device properties page.
[ ] implement the audio device selection page.
[ ] make a zither layout
[ ] the position of the touch between the frets could modulate the pick position filter.
[ ] the instantaneous velocity of the finger at contact could modulate pick direction.
[ ] I keep thinking that a way to barre might be useful, but then I cannot see how it
 would work.  If you tune an open chord, then any combination of notes across at a fret
 is a chord, and you just move up and down the frets to play different chords.  You can't
 play open strings.
[ ] More useful would be a way to mute the strings, or selectively mute the strings.
[ ] Send each note on its own channel, so it will have its own channel messages.
    Not sure if the channel is implemented, half remember that it isn't.
    But make it work by making 16 synths with no sharing.
[ ] switching on device rotation is very disruptive.
[ ] rotating from portrait to landscape and back reduces the fretlabels to microscopic
    in portrait.  The sizes are stable after the first two swaps.
    Other oddities arise, too, the control panel resizes and relocates to mid screen.
[ ] eks - don't see why the pick position is restricted to 0.5 max, maybe it's symmetric
    around the midpoint?
[ ] the pm guitar models appear to use string models, bridge models, nut models, pick
    position, direction, angle, pickup location.  I'm not seeing that they share a parameter
    space, between the different guitars.  tweak the string stiffness.  Well work at
    figuring it out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] I like the Obsidian idea of pushing everything into an infinite canvas,
    rather than imposing some predefined structuring onto the set of possibilities.
[ ] So we start with a keyboard/fretboard/whatever playing surface, and a patch
    for the sound engine.  Pinch to zoom shrinks the current patch/surface to its
    representation on the infinite canvas, where push to scroll, pinch to zoom, and
    drag to move allow you to rearrange.
[ ] A scrolling gesture can retune the fretboard, either by moving the nut up or down
	or by scrolling to add another string.
[ ] A pinch to zoom gesture could change the number of strings, or adjust the fret spacing.
[ ] A scroll of a single string could retune the string 
[ ] the toplevel faust directory needs to clone and set up the faustwasm application
	and use it to do the processing.  Rather than depending on the clone that I
	made manually.  I don't know if it depends on the faust installation, I think
	not but I should test.
[ ] The models need to be as lean as possible.  Multi notes choke the ONN tablet.
[ ] there's a thought about sharing the delay line between instances of the synth.
[ ] The pixel 7a choked after a while

[x] Does the full screen API give better control over miscellaneous chrome?
    Well, some of the chrome hangs around on the iPad, but it really cleans up
    on android.
[ ] make sure that pwa builds from github, may have lost some of the copy logic
    required to recreate out-tsc and dist from scratch.
[x] PWA can exit with window.close().
    Only on more recent devices.  SE failed to exit or even make noise.  Moto
    failed to exit.
[x] PWA can be forced to update by changes to webmanifest or service worker.
[x] Can solve button accessibility problems with sl-button, and use the
    sl-icon library, too.  
	Use 'gear' settings icon for 'tune instrument'.
	Use 'x-large' for 'close instrument'.
	Use 'music-note-beamed' for 'play instrument'.
[?] Fix the background on the zither desktop icon theme color? ...
    I get white on IOS and gray on Android.
    I think I'm stuck with them.
[x] Can detect touchscreen with media query:
    if(window.matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)").matches) {
      // touchscreen
    }
    https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#descdef-media-any-pointer
    Can confess to the failings of the program on desktops and laptops.
    Didn't work.
[ ] Need a tone control that tracks the string's fundamental frequency.
    https://faustlibraries.grame.fr/libs/filters/ faust filter library
    has parts for assembling an equalizer.
[ ] Don't need the nonlinear junk.
[ ] Need stiffness.
[ ] line of green at bottom of fretboard, off by one?
[ ] resize the harp buttons, maybe tilt them from corner to corner to make
    more space.
[ ] Make the 'tune' button on the fretboard only show after some time
    without played notes, then it can fade back in, fade out as soon as
    playing starts.
[x] Fix the mandolin.
[x] Eliminate the shorthand tunings.
[ ] Reinstate the shorthand tunings, assuming you can translate all such guitar
    tunings programatically.
[x] Fix the 8 string bass tunings.
[x] Add a bunch of harp tunings.
