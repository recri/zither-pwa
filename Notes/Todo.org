[x] turn off the logging!
[x] default to eks
[x] even with eks the pixel 7a crashes the zither window when
[ ] may want a soft touch limit, might even be able to run a test to find it, virtual
	tapping at various rates, record successful tests in the database, record the
	start of unsuccessful tests in the database, choose boundaries from 
[ ] recheck performance limits
[ ] implement the mechanical properties page (strings, courses, frets, tunings, etc.)
[ ] implement the audio device properties page.
[ ] implement the audio device selection page.
[ ] make a zither layout
[ ] the position of the touch between the frets could modulate the pick position filter.
[ ] the instantaneous velocity of the finger at contact could modulate pick direction.
[ ] I keep thinking that a way to barre might be useful, but then I cannot see how it
 would work.  If you tune an open chord, then any combination of notes across at a fret
 is a chord, and you just move up and down the frets to play different chords.  You can't
 play open strings.
[ ] More useful would be a way to mute the strings, or selectively mute the strings.
[ ] Send each note on its own channel, so it will have its own channel messages.
    Not sure if the channel is implemented, half remember that it isn't.
[ ] switching on device rotation is very disruptive.
[ ] rotating from portrait to landscape and back reduces the fretlabels to microscopic
    in portrait.  The sizes are stable after the first two swaps.
[ ] eks - don't see why the pick position is restricted to 0.5 max, maybe it's symmetric
    around the midpoint?
[ ] the pm guitar models appear to use string models, bridge models, nut models, pick
    position, direction, angle, pickup location.  I'm not seeing that they share a parameter
    space, between the different guitars.  tweak the string stiffness.  Well work at
    figuring it out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] I like the Obsidian idea of pushing everything into an infinite canvas,
    rather than imposing some predefined structuring onto the set of possibilities.
[ ] So we start with a keyboard/fretboard/whatever playing surface, and a patch
    for the sound engine.  Pinch to zoom shrinks the current patch/surface to its
    representation on the infinite canvas, where push to scroll, pinch to zoom, and
    drag to move allow you to rearrange.
[ ] A scrolling gesture can retune the fretboard, either by moving the nut up or down
	or by scrolling to add another string.
[ ] A pinch to zoom gesture could change the number of strings, or adjust the fret spacing.
[ ] A scroll of a single string could retune the string 
[ ] the toplevel faust directory needs to clone and set up the faustwasm application
	and use it to do the processing.  Rather than depending on the clone that I
	made manually.  I don't know if it depends on the faust installation, I think
	not but I should test.
[ ] The models need to be as lean as possible.  Multi notes choke the ONN tablet.
[ ] there's a thought about sharing the delay line between instances of the synth.
[ ] The pixel 7a choked after a while
[ ] Does the full screen API give better control over miscellaneous chrome?
