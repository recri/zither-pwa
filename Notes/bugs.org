[ ] The web-dev-server crashes when it can't resolve import('fs') and import('url')
    which are nodejs packages that aren't used on the web.  Both rollup and esbuild
    have options for declaring packages external and hence ignorable, but web-dev-server
    didn't get the message.
    Mangled the source files (from @grame/faustwasm) to avoid this problem.
[ ] The rollup resolver loses its mind under mysterious conditions and attempts to
    define a class as extending an undefined symbol.  Backtracked through the changes
    and determined that moving the faustwasm/index.* from src/faust to just src was
    the trigger.  I attempted to backport the change into main.  The branch with the
    change worked, I swear it did, but the branch with the change merged back into
    main did not work.  And when I switched back to the branch with the change, it
    no longer worked.
    This only happens when you build for distribution.  The symptom is that the build
    throws an error while loading in the chrome console, and the FaustWasm classes needed
    are not defined, and the app does not work.
    Have retreated to the backtracked retro2 branch to do further work.
