[ ] Okay, so the chapman stick lays out bass and melody courses 
    for the two hands to play, left hand playing the melody while
    right hand taps the bass.  But the notes still go from lowest
    at the "nut" to highest at the "bridge".  But we can make the
    frets work anyway we want, so why not put the lowest notes
    toward the thumb of the right hand and the little finger of
    the left hand.  Which would also suggest putting the bass
    on the left hand side and the treble on the right hand side.
[ ] If we can retune the midi note table, shouldn't be hard, then
    we can do 24-tet and 31-tet with chromatic fretting.  All that
    needs is a font with the half-flat and half-sharp characers.
[ ] All of these variations need to go into a database that can
    be exported and imported and edited as necessary.
[ ] All of the configuration options for the instrument should be
    remotely controllable from another phone/tablet/laptop via
    osc over websocket, this is how you tweak the string tone
    while playing.  The playing surface should be full screen and
    immune to most everything.  Set a gesture to escape back to
    the configuration screens.
[ ] Vibraphone model in modal bars, one of several presets for the
    instrument which need to be faustified to compile to wasm.
    It seems that the parameters could be bundled as a with clause
    or something, in any case made constant.  Vibraphone on a 
    fretboard could be outrageous, have to get some feedback on it.
[ ] https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/pasp.html has the details
    on stiffness.  But the Faust physical models library guitar
    model uses a coefficient of nearly 0 for steel guitar, and 0.4
    for the nylon strings, so the filter may just be left out of the
    eks.
[ ] Pentatonic scales https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale
    5 modes of pentatonic: major, blues major, minor, blues minor, and
    suspended (aka egyptian!).  Also named in chinese and south asian
    traditions.
