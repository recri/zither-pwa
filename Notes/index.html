  <a href="https://zither.elf.org">zither</a> is a synthesized string instrument for phones, tablets, chromebooks, 2-in-1 laptops, etc.
  It should work on any device with a web browser and a touch screen, though it has stopped working on my IPhone SE MXCH2LL/A.
  It is very much a project under construction.

  The app displays a rectangular grid of buttons labelled with note names.
  The configuration options are reached through the [Gear] button, which only appears after a period of inactivity.  
  The notes displayed for fretted instruments are determined by the treatment of [Offscale] 
  notes in the selected [Scale] rooted at the selected [Tonic].

  It is coded in typescript using lit-html and the recommendations of open-wc.org.
