[ ] I like the Obsidian idea of pushing everything into an infinite canvas,
    rather than imposing some predefined structuring onto the set of possibilities.
[ ] So we start with a keyboard/fretboard/whatever playing surface, and a patch
    for the sound engine.  Pinch to zoom shrinks the current patch/surface to its
    representation on the infinite canvas, where push to scroll, pinch to zoom, and
    drag to move allow you to rearrange.
