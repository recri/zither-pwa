[ ] I like the Obsidian idea of pushing everything into an infinite canvas,
    rather than imposing some predefined structuring onto the set of possibilities.
[ ] So we start with a keyboard/fretboard/whatever playing surface, and a patch
    for the sound engine.  Pinch to zoom shrinks the current patch/surface to its
    representation on the infinite canvas, where push to scroll, pinch to zoom, and
    drag to move allow you to rearrange.
[ ] Well, that's one application of the gestures.  
[ ] A scrolling gesture can retune the fretboard, either by moving the nut up or down
	or by scrolling to add another string.
[ ] A pinch to zoom gesture could change the number of strings, or adjust the fret spacing.
[ ] A scroll of a single string could tune the string 
[ ] the position of the touch between the frets could modulate the pick position filter.
[ ] the instantaneous velocity of the finger at contact could modulate pick direction.
[ ] I keep thinking that a way to barre might be useful, but then I cannot see how it
 would work.  If you tune an open chord, then any combination of notes across at a fret
 is a chord, and you just move up and down the frets to play different chords.  You can't
 play open strings.
[ ] More useful would be a way to mute the strings, or selectively mute the strings.
